# RAG based PDF QnA Agent using Groq, Hugging Face & FAISS

https://pdf-query-rag.streamlit.app/

This project implements a Question-Answering (QnA) application for PDF documents using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Groq (LPU™ Inference Engine), Hugging Face Embeddings, and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search). The app allows users to input PDF files and query specific information from within these documents using natural language questions.

# Features:-

-> PDF Input: Upload PDF files containing structured information.

-> Natural Language Queries: Ask questions in natural language related to the content of the PDF.

-> Rag Integration: Uses Rag for improved question understanding and answer generation.

-> Groq (LPU™ Inference Engine): Powers efficient inference for handling complex queries.

-> Hugging Face Embeddings: Embeds documents and queries for semantic similarity matching.

-> FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Indexes embeddings for fast, scalable similarity search.
